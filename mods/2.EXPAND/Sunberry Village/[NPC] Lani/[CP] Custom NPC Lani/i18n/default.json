	"ThePerfectVideoGame.7": "See, modding a game gives me the ability to have customization AND a good plot!$4#$b#...Provided someone makes a mod that edits those things, anyways. But you understand the vision, @.$3",
	"ThePerfectVideoGame.8": "I mean, a good art direction seems to be pretty important in any video game, right?$2",
	"ThePerfectVideoGame.9": "Yeah, graphics ARE pretty important.$12#$b#I'm a fan of more stylized stuff, though, since realistic graphics can get dated pretty quickly.$7#$b#Stylized toony stuff and pixel art are timeless.$1",

	"KyoufuuAllBack.3": "Tell the story about how you became a farmer.",
	"KyoufuuAllBack.4": "You explain how you were tired of corporate life and finally read your grandfather's letter you'd kept for years.",
	"KyoufuuAllBack.5": "At first, the words are a little forced, but as you talk more about your new life, the words flow easier.",
	"KyoufuuAllBack.6": "A few minutes pass...",
	"KyoufuuAllBack.7": "Woah, I didn't know you went through all that! It sounds straight out of a TV show.$16#$b#You get a letter from your grandfather, get a whole bunch of land, and escape the city to become a farmer...$12#$b#I guess there really isn't a problem with starting something new. You're right, @.$1",

	"OpenWounds.4": "But yeah, I ended up pursuing a degree in art thinking it'd give me the skills to get my foot in the door.$7#$b#Spoiler alert: it did not.$8",
	"OpenWounds.5": "I'd spent all these years improving my art skill to achieve this pipe dream of becoming a game artist.$6#$b#I felt if I didn't do something with it, I wouldn't be able to live with myself...$2#$b#I burnt myself out so hard in college that I haven't drawn a single thing since.$2",

	"PaintingWithLyenne.4": "Lani, no! You did something, and you should be proud of it.$3#$b#Not everyone is going to paint the Mona Lisa when they pick up a brush.",
	"PaintingWithLyenne.5": "It's clear the brush strokes on the left are hesitant, trying to form a hazy idea, but the ones on the right are careless, angry, and resentful.",
	"PaintingWithLyenne.6": "It's not bad, all things considered, but it's not what Lani's aiming for.",
	"PaintingWithLyenne.7": "I tried to be a little more 'interpretive' and paint a representation of an emotion, but you can obviously see how that went.$6",
	"PaintingWithLyenne.8": "Umm, obviously good? I can totally see how you were feeling.$1#$b#See your brush strokes on the right? Totally angry.$3",
